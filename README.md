# Montreal-City-Crime-Data-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed Montreal city crime data (2015 - 2017) with a goal of providing solutions to the following key questions among other findings noted in the analysis:

1. What are the top 3 prevalent crimes or offenses committed in 2015, 2016 and 2017 in Montreal City?
2. Which neighborhoods recorded the highest crime incidents in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and what are the crime types in these neighborhoods?
3. Which neighborhood has the highest cases of murder crime in 2015, 2016 and 2017?
4. What part of the day did most crime incidents occur in 2015, 2016 and 2017?
5. Which top 5 police stations (PDQ) got the most crime complaints in 2015, 2016 and 2017?
6. Which are the top 3 PDQs that got least crime complaints in 2015, 2016 and 2017?
